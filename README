Automatically generates tkinter forms by reading a jsonschema document.

The json files are found through the read_with_id method in the read_schema.py module.
By default, it will look for files in a directory called "resources": tests will fail without this directory.

For now, schema files that contain references (through "$ref" or "data" keywords) must have a "file_dependencies"
property with as value the list of the referenced files


form_builder.py is the main file (and will be split in the future). It handles the recursive building of the form and
the interpretation of the user's inputs

scrollable_frame.py and tooltip.py are custom widgets for tkinter

validation.py upgrades the standard jsonschema validator with two extra keywords:
 - data lets you get data from any json file, including the instance
 - isPropertyOf lets you indicate that the value must be a property of a specific object
 (json equivalent to key of specific dictionary)
